					The fast-paced, dynamic environment at Blue Heron Books, an award-winning Independent book store, has taught me a lot about multi-tasking and prioritizing!  I have learned precision in cash-balancing, and perfected my organizational skills as I make recommendations to customers, receive and ship books, and create effective merchandising displays all simultaneously!   This entrepreneurial setting has helped me develop excellent communication skills through interacting with customers of all ages, fellow staff, community professionals, as well as visiting authors.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					As one of thirty teen girls chosen (from applicants nationally) to attend the inaugural Bootcamp for Brains (2016), I was privileged to participate in an inspiring week of seminars and workshops with engaged, motivated teens from across Canada. We were instructed and challenged by relevant industry experts, corporate representatives, as well as government officials. The Arts of Finance, Leadership, Communication, Self-Branding and Risk were explored. This program had a lasting impact on me by reinforcing the value of setting a course and sourcing others to help guide the way.  The network of young women and mentors built that week is a valuable foundation for me and I am inspired to participate in other G(irls)20 programs including Girls on Boards and upcoming Global Summits.

					Our Uxbridge Fall Fair is an annual agricultural event for young and old and I am honoured to be a Junior Director (2012-currently), coordinating the Saturday Children's Contests (Ugly Bug contest, Pet Show, Nail Hammering contest, Doll and Teddy Bear Show). I am also a participant in the Fair Homecrafts competition and was Teen Division Overall Points Winner 2013, 2014.  In advance of our weekend Fair, I help choose the creative categories, seek sponsorship prizes from local businesses, and promote the contests. Enthusiasm is essential on Fair weekend! Running on schedule and ensuring all ages enjoy the activities and contests is something I excel at. Community service should begin in our youth, and I intend to pursue positions on other Boards to have a voice not only in the business world, but on community, charitable and societal issues.

				<p>
					Having participated as a soccer player in the Uxbridge Soccer Club for 10+ years, I was excited to add the refereeing experience. As a paid Youth Referee (2015-2018), I oversee recreational youth soccer games (ages 12-15 years), and ensure safe and respectful play, following the FIFA regulations and rules. Refereeing requires acute observation skills, quick decision-making abilities and patience and confidence when communicating with players and parents. Refereeing has provided me the opportunity to show young female players that they can play soccer right through their teens and into adulthood, as well as earn the position of referee. Sport helps young women feel healthy, boosts their self-confidence and develops teamwork skills.  Entry Level Referee Clinic and examination was completed for membership in The Ontario Soccer Association.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Participating with 50 students from across Canada at the Waterloo Unlimited week-long enrichment camp was an unforgettable experience! Access to university life, and integrating and interacting with program staff, professors and students from a variety of backgrounds made it an exciting time.  Focusing on the theme “design”, we participated in lectures, workshops and skills sessions where we implemented a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving to arrive at innovative solutions.  For me, this experience reinforced the importance of sourcing multiple experts with a variety of perspectives to achieve the top results.

			<h3>Silver Award Recipient (2017)</h3>
			<h3>Gold Award Candidate (2018)</h3>
			<h5>Duke of Edinburgh International Award</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">
				<img src="./assets/Duke.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					The Duke of Edinburgh Award challenges me to set and achieve goals, over 18 months, in five areas: community service, skills (film-making, language, piano lessons/composition), physical recreation, and an adventurous journey. I have volunteered in my school and community for many years (logging 200+ hours of service in the last 36 months), yet the award criteria challenges me to volunteer in unfamiliar settings (fundraising door to door for Heart & Stroke) and take on new projects (researching a soil contamination/remediation incident, composing original piano pieces to play at the Sunderland Music Festival). I am using this award to push myself to become more skilled in areas like dance (urban!), and to explore opportunities for service and leadership. In summer 2015 and again in 2018, I completed the adventurous expedition where I canoed 60kms+ into Algonquin Park back country, camped and carried all the required supplies!  I have now completed all the criteria for the Gold Award and look forward to submitting my final report.

			<div class="five columns no-margin">

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Participating in Ontario Nature’s Youth Summit (September 2015 and 2016) was an exciting opportunity to join a diverse group of youth leaders on the shores of Lake Couchiching for a weekend of exploration, discovery and education.  As a young naturalist, I am interested in the preservation of our environment by encouraging responsibility towards nature.  Engaging workshops allowed me to interact with professionals and learn more about delicate ecosystems and species.  My favourite workshops included: Medicinal Plants of Ontario, Help Strenghten the Ontario Environmental Bill of Rights (OEBR), and The Conservation Conversation.

			<h3>Founder and Player</h3>
			<h5>Uxbridge Secondary School Ultimate Frisbee Team</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">
				<img src="./assets/ultimate.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Identifying the need for an inclusive sports team which required limited equipment and gave students of all abilities the chance to participate, I started a high school Ultimate Frisbee Team in the Fall of 2016. After getting school permission and enlisting a teacher's commitment to supervise, I organized announcements and purchased Daredevil Discs from Ottawa. Our first two sessions saw 18+ students participating! Starting the Ultimate Team brought up many roadblocks, but I created a plan and worked through each of the obstacles by gaining support—for example, the company providing the Frisbees was excited about our new school team and provided discounted Frisbees, some free Frisbees and stickers for everyone on the team.  Also, I was told there were not any teachers available to supervise, but building on a relationship from grade 9, I persuaded my teacher to come out and learn about Ultimate.  Finally, we had everything necessary for a school team!  We had a strong turnout for the fall session and great success competing in divisional tournaments in Spring 2017. I'm looking forward to another great season 2017/2018.

			<h3>Senior Dancer</h3>
			<h5>Uxbridge Dance Academy, Uxbridge, ON</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">
				<img src="./assets/ballet2.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Dedication and determination have seen me grow into an accomplished dancer.  With Uxbridge Dance Academy, I have spent 7+ years regularly participating in over eight hours of dance instruction (ballet, pointe, lyrical, jazz, hip hop, tap, acro) weekly, as well as additional practice time at home.  I have also been privileged to dance with the Uxbridge Secondary School Dance Company (2014/15), and participate in three productions of The Nutcracker (various roles), as well as several competitions, dance choreography showcases, and many annual recitals. Dance is a primary focus in my life; I have learned to be a constructive collaborator and positive team member.   New this year, I’m proud to have earned a place on the VYbE Dance Company’s Advanced Performance team, FX!  Their street-style urban dance is fast-paced and challenges me to push beyond my comfort zone and interpret music in new ways.  Dancing requires patience as every series of movements needs to be repeated endlessly to achieve the final (near) perfect result. Dancing is my creative outlet and I find ways to incorporate it into other projects such as school assignments and film-making.

			<h5>Vimy Ridge 100th Anniversary Trip, April 2017</h5>
			<div class="five columns no-margin">
				<img src="./assets/vimy.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					In April 2017, I embarked on a ten day pilgrimage to Europe with fifty Uxbridge students to tour historic battlefields, graveyards, and museums in France and Belgium, and to participate in the 100th Anniversary of the Vimy Battle. In preparation, I connected with the stories of WWI veterans and visited with local WWII veterans before tracing their footsteps over the beaches and battlefields of Europe. I cannot describe the impact this experience has had on my life—my understanding of veterans, the horrors of war, and gratitude for my citizenship and freedom.  My research gave me an awareness of the desperate conditions of war and the devastating consequences to all soldiers. Researching my great grandfather’s five years of service in WWII provided a connection to the places I visited.  This experience continues as I am inspired to learn more about the sacrifices made by our veterans and my place as a Canadian in the world.

			<div class="seven columns">
				<p>
					Working in our local independent book store helped me recognize an opportunity for youth.  Despite our vibrant literary community, we were lacking a year-long teen bookclub, so with the support of Blue Heron Books (quarterly bookclub meetings/refreshments) and enthusiasm from local teens, I'm facilitating a Teen Book Club!  The Teen Book Club "Nightlights" (see our Facebook group) is already planning it's next meeting to discuss the book, The Light Between The Oceans by M.L.Stedman. Previously we read, Everyday by David Levithan. This bookclub provides a fun, social atmosphere where the only rule at meetings is to respect others' opinions.
