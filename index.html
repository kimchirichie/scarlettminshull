								As one of thirty teen girls chosen (from applicants nationally) to attend the inaugural
								Bootcamp for Brains (2016), I was privileged to participate in an inspiring week of seminars
								and workshops with engaged, motivated teens from across Canada. We were instructed and 
								challenged by relevant industry experts, corporate representatives, as well as government 
								officials. The Arts of Finance, Leadership, Communication, Self-Branding and Risk were explored.
								This program had a lasting impact on me by reinforcing the value of setting a course and
								sourcing others to help guide the way.  The network of young women and mentors built that week
								is a valuable foundation for me and I am inspired to participate in other G(irls)20 programs
								including Girls on Boards and upcoming Global Summits.

								Our Uxbridge Fall Fair is an annual agricultural event for young and old and I am honoured

								(Ugly Bug contest, Pet Show, Nail Hammering contest, Doll and Teddy Bear Show). I am also 
								a participant in the Fair Homecrafts competition and was Teen Division Overall Points Winner
								2013, 2014.  In advance of our weekend Fair, I help choose the creative categories, seek 
								sponsorship prizes from local businesses, and promote the contests. Enthusiasm is essential 
								on Fair weekend! Running on schedule and ensuring all ages enjoy the activities and contests 
								is something I excel at. Community service should begin in our youth, and I intend to pursue 
								positions on other Boards to have a voice not only in the business world, but on community, 
								charitable and societal issues.

								Having participated as a soccer player in the Uxbridge Soccer Club for 10+ years, I was excited
								to add the refereeing experience. As a paid Youth Referee (2015-2018), I oversee recreational youth 
								soccer games (ages 12-15 years), and ensure safe and respectful play, following the FIFA regulations
								and rules. Refereeing requires acute observation skills, quick decision-making abilities and 
								patience and confidence when communicating with players and parents. Refereeing has provided me 
								the opportunity to show young female players that they can play soccer right through their teens 
								and into adulthood, as well as earn the position of referee. Sport helps young women feel healthy, 
								boosts their self-confidence and develops teamwork skills.  Entry Level Referee Clinic and 
								examination was completed for membership in The Ontario Soccer Association.

								Participating with 50 students from across Canada at the Waterloo Unlimited week-long enrichment

								Focusing on the theme “design”, we participated in lectures, workshops and skills sessions where
								we implemented a multi-disciplinary approach to problem solving to arrive at innovative solutions.
								For me, this experience reinforced the importance of sourcing multiple experts with a variety 
								of perspectives to achieve the top results.

								The Duke of Edinburgh Award challenges me to set and achieve goals, over 18 months, in five areas: 
								community service, skills (film-making, language, piano lessons/composition), physical recreation, 
								and an adventurous journey. I have volunteered in my school and community for many years 
								(logging 200+ hours of service in the last 36 months), yet the award criteria challenges me to
								volunteer in unfamiliar settings (fundraising door to door for Heart & Stroke) and take on new
								projects (researching a soil contamination/remediation incident, composing original piano pieces 
								to play at the Sunderland Music Festival). I am using this award to push myself to become more 
								skilled in areas like dance (urban!), and to explore opportunities for service and leadership. 
								In summer 2015 and again in 2018, I completed the adventurous expedition where I canoed 60kms+ 
								into Algonquin Park back country, camped and carried all the required supplies! I have now completed all
								the criteria for the Gold Award and look forward to submitting my final report.

								Participating in Ontario Nature’s Youth Summit (September 2015 and 2016) was an exciting opportunity
								to join a diverse group of youth leaders on the shores of Lake Couchiching for a weekend of exploration,
								discovery and education.  As a young naturalist, I am interested in the preservation of our environment
								by encouraging responsibility towards nature.  Engaging workshops allowed me to interact with
								professionals and learn more about delicate ecosystems and species. My favourite workshops included:
								Medicinal Plants of Ontario, Help Strenghten the Ontario Environmental Bill of Rights (OEBR), and
								The Conservation Conversation.

					<h3>Founder and Player</h3>

							<p>
								Identifying the need for an inclusive sports team which required limited equipment and gave students 
								of all abilities the chance to participate, I started a high school Ultimate Frisbee Team in the Fall 
								of 2016. After getting school permission and enlisting a teacher's commitment to supervise, I organized
								announcements and purchased Daredevil Discs from Ottawa. Our first two sessions saw 18+ students 
								participating! Starting the Ultimate Team brought up many roadblocks, but I created a plan and worked 
								through each of the obstacles by gaining support—for example, the company providing the Frisbees was
								excited about our new school team and provided discounted Frisbees, some free Frisbees and stickers 
								for everyone on the team.  Also, I was told there were not any teachers available to supervise, but 
								building on a relationship from grade 9, I persuaded my teacher to come out and learn about Ultimate. 
								Finally, we had everything necessary for a school team!  We had a strong turnout for the fall session 
								and great success competing in divisional tournaments in Spring 2017. I'm looking forward to another
								great season 2017/2018.

								Dedication and determination have seen me grow into an accomplished dancer. With Uxbridge Dance Academy, 
								I have spent 7+ years regularly participating in over eight hours of dance instruction (ballet, pointe, 
								lyrical, jazz, hip hop, tap, acro) weekly, as well as additional practice time at home. I have also been 
								privileged to dance with the Uxbridge Secondary School Dance Company (2014/15), and participate in three
								productions of The Nutcracker (various roles), as well as several competitions, dance choreography showcases,
								and many annual recitals. Dance is a primary focus in my life; I have learned to be a constructive collaborator
								and positive team member.   New this year, I’m proud to have earned a place on the VYbE Dance Company’s Advanced
								Performance team, FX!  Their street-style urban dance is fast-paced and challenges me to push beyond my comfort
								zone and interpret music in new ways.  Dancing requires patience as every series of movements needs to be 
								repeated endlessly to achieve the final (near) perfect result. Dancing is my creative outlet and I find ways
								to incorporate it into other projects such as school assignments and film-making.

								In April 2017, I embarked on a ten day pilgrimage to Europe with fifty Uxbridge students to tour historic
								battlefields, graveyards, and museums in France and Belgium, and to participate in the 100th Anniversary
								of the Vimy Battle. In preparation, I connected with the stories of WWI veterans and visited with local 
								WWII veterans before tracing their footsteps over the beaches and battlefields of Europe. I cannot 
								describe the impact this experience has had on my life—my understanding of veterans, the horrors of war,
								and gratitude for my citizenship and freedom.  My research gave me an awareness of the desperate 
								conditions of war and the devastating consequences to all soldiers. Researching my great grandfather’s
								five years of service in WWII provided a connection to the places I visited.  This experience continues
								as I am inspired to learn more about the sacrifices made by our veterans and my place as a Canadian in the world.

								Working in our local independent book store helped me recognize an opportunity for youth. Despite our
								vibrant literary community, we were lacking a year-long teen bookclub, so with the support of Blue Heron 
								Books (quarterly bookclub meetings/refreshments) and enthusiasm from local teens, I'm facilitating a Teen
								Book Club!  The Teen Book Club "Nightlights" (see our Facebook group) is already planning it's next meeting
								to discuss the book, The Light Between The Oceans by M.L.Stedman. Previously we read, Everyday by 
								David Levithan. This bookclub provides a fun, social atmosphere where the only rule at meetings is to
								respect others' opinions.
